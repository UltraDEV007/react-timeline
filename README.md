# react-component-boilerplate - Boilerplate for React.js components

This is a simple boilerplate that has been developed to make it easier to develop React components. Check out [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/) to dig deeper into the topic.

## Basic Usage

* Replacing meta information  - **npm run replace-meta** - This will allow you to update project metadata (GitHub user/project). Note that this can be potentially dangerous since it does just a naive search/replace over *README.md* and *package.json*!
* Linting - **npm run lint** - ESLint.
* Testing - **npm test** - Karma/Mocha/Chai/Phantom.
* Developing - **npm start** - This will run a server at *localhost:8080* and use Hot Module Reloading.
* Demo deployment - **npm run gh-pages** and **npm run deploy-gh-pages** - Demo will contain *README.md* by default and comes with simple styling based on Pure.
* Generating a distribution version - **npm run dist-all** - This will generate `/dist` (UMD bundle + minified UMD bundle) and `/dist-modules`. Latter contains a version of `/src` that has been run through babel. It is meant for NPM users.

Note that there are hooks for `npm version`. The system will run tests, generate a distribution bundle and include that into the version commit. This can fail in case dist doesn't contain any changes! After that has completed it will generate GitHub Pages and deploy a new version.

`npm publish` will generate and push *demo* to **gh-pages**.

## Highlighting Demo

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 10;

// just trying out code highlighting feature here
console.log(a + b);
```
