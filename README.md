# react-component-boilerplate - Boilerplate for React.js components

This is a simple boilerplate that has been developed to make it easier to develop React components. Pretty meta, eh?

## Basic Usage

* Linting - **npm run lint**
* Testing - **npm test** - This will lint too.
* Developing - **npm start** - This will run a server at *localhost:3000* and use Hot Module Reloading.
* Demo deployment - **npm run gh-pages** and **npm run deploy-gh-pages** - Demo will contain *README.md* by default and comes with simple styling based on Pure.

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 10;

// just trying out code highlighting feature here
console.log(a + b);
```
