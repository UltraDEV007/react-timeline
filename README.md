# react-component-boilerplate - Boilerplate for React.js components

This is a simple boilerplate that has been developed to make it easier to develop React components. Pretty meta, eh?

## Basic Features

* eslint. Invoke `npm run lint` for this
* Testing based on Jest. Hit `npm test`.
* Webpack goodness (JSX, hot module reloading etc.). Just `npm install` and `npm start`
* Simple demo deployment flow via `npm run gh-pages` and `npm run deploy-gh-pages`
* Demo will contain `README.md` by default and comes with simple styling based on Pure

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 10;

// just trying out code highlighting feature here
console.log(a + b);
```
